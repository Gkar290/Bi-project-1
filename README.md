#PROJECT BI-1
1.PROJECT TITTLE- 
HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD

2.PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT-
TO ANALYZE, VISUALIZE, AND MONITOR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION TRENDS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY DRIVERS, MITIGATE TURNOVER RISK, AND SUPPORT DATA-DRIVEN HR DECISION-MAKING.

LIST THE KEY TECHNOLOGIES USED TO BUILD THE DASHBOARD-
POWER BI DESKTOP -MAIN DATA VISUALIZATION PLATFORM USED FOR REPORT CREATION.
POWER QUERY -DATA TRANSFORMATION AND CLEANING LAYER FOR RESHAPING AND PREPARING THE DATA.
MICROSOFT EXCEL-FORMATTING AND INITIAL LEVEL OF DATA CLEANING BEFORE IT EXPORTING TO POWER QUERY

GOAL OF THE DASHBOARD-
TO ANALYZE EMPLOYEE ATTRITION TRENDS AND UNCOVER KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING ATTRITION IN ORDER TO SUPPORT DATA-DRIVEN STRATEGIES FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND WORKFORCE PLANNING.

KEY INSIGHTS-
 AGE DEMOGRAPHICS: THE HIGHEST RATE OF ATTRITION IS OBSERVED AMONG EMPLOYEES AGED BETWEEN 25 AND 36. THIS AGE GROUP APPEARS TO BE THE MOST MOBILE, POSSIBLY DUE TO EVOLVING CAREER ASPIRATIONS AND COMPETITIVE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.
TENURE WITH ORGANIZATION: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF EMPLOYEES TEND TO LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. THIS INDICATES POTENTIAL ISSUES IN ONBOARDING EFFECTIVENESS, CULTURAL ALIGNMENT, OR UNMET EXPECTATIONS DURING EARLY EMPLOYMENT.
COMPENSATION INSIGHTS: EMPLOYEES WHO EXITED THE ORGANIZATION WERE OFTEN FOUND TO BE EARNING SALARIES BELOW THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT COMPENSATION PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN EMPLOYEE RETENTION.
EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND: STAFF WITH EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS IN MEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES DEMONSTRATED HIGHER ATTRITION RATES COMPARED TO OTHER ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES. THIS COULD REFLECT EITHER A MISMATCH BETWEEN QUALIFICATIONS AND JOB ROLES OR BETTER OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR CORE FIELDS OUTSIDE THE ORGANIZATION.
JOB ROLE-SPECIFIC ATTRITION: THE ROLES OF LAB TECHNICIAN AND SALES EXECUTIVE EXHIBITED NOTABLY HIGHER ATTRITION RATES. THESE ROLES MAY INVOLVE OPERATIONAL PRESSURES, LIMITED GROWTH TRAJECTORIES, OR MARKET DEMAND CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER TURNOVER.
GENDER-BASED TRENDS: THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT MALE EMPLOYEES ARE LEAVING THE ORGANIZATION AT A HIGHER RATE THAN FEMALE EMPLOYEES. WHILE THIS TREND REQUIRES DEEPER EXPLORATION, IT MAY POINT TO DIFFERENT CAREER EXPECTATIONS OR EXTERNAL FACTORS INFLUENCING WORKFORCE PARTICIPATION

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
THE INSIGHTS FROM THE ATTRITION ANALYSIS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROACTIVE EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES, ESPECIALLY TARGETING EARLY-STAGE EMPLOYEES AND HIGH-TURNOVER ROLES. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE:
ENHANCING ONBOARDING AND MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE EARLY EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCES.
REVIEWING AND REALIGNING COMPENSATION STRUCTURES TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EQUITABLE.
CONDUCTING ROLE-SPECIFIC ENGAGEMENT SURVEYS TO IDENTIFY JOB-SPECIFIC PAIN POINTS.
IMPLEMENTING TARGETED RETENTION PLANS FOR HIGH-ATTRITION JOB ROLES.
EXPLORING FLEXIBLE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLANS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE 25â€“36 AGE GROUP.
ADDRESSING THESE AREAS CAN LEAD TO MORE INFORMED WORKFORCE STRATEGIES AND A REDUCTION IN UNWANTED ATTRITION, THEREBY SUPPORTING THE LONG-TERM GROWTH AND STABILITY OF THE ORGANIZATION.
